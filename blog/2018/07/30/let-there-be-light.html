<h3>Introductions</h3>
<p>So the web-based home of all things Liam Graham has arrived (hold the fanfare). There's
never been a more awaited event in blogging, etc. etc.</p>
<p>I don't have any grand plans for this site or blog, nor did I create them as a monument
to my web development capabilities (web dev is neither a strength nor an interest of
mine at this stage). The website will serve a as public-facing profile, in lieu of a
Twitter account and allowing more creative control (which I've taken full advantage of
with the hyper-minimal black-text-on-a-white-background look). As the blog is unlikely
to become fodder for any '30 Blogs Every Software Developer Should Be Reading' article,
I'm just going to use it as repository for my thoughts and reflections on my journey (?)
as a software engineer, without to attempting to build or appeal to an audience. I think
there's a genuine value to this kind of introspection, as it demands the active
contemplation of decisions and actions in a manner that one might not necessarily engage
in 'in the moment', if ever. The blog will also become, in aggregate, a document of my
progress and pitfalls and growth and explorations, if I do end up posting with any kind
of regularity. </p>
<h3>Developing the Website</h3>
<p>After unsuccessfully tinkering with Frozen-Flask and briefly contemplating installing Jekyll on
Windows, I decided to instead write some simple Python scripts that would generate the static blog
content from markdown files, with the rest of the site being plain, handwritten HTML.
Specifically, the Python would take all the .md files, convert them to HTML using the
'markdown' module and place the resulting files in directories corresponding to the post
dates (to imitate the standard '.../blog/&lt;year>/&lt;month>/&lt;day>/&lt;post-name>' format for blogs),
as well as creating links to each of them in blog.html. This enabled me to still write and
format the posts using markdown without having to work with a framework or static site
generator (albeit in a way not nearly as clean) or write the HTML for the posts by hand. </p>
<p>I'm forever afraid that my approach entirely contravenes the best practice
for whatever it is I'm attempting, or that there's some wonderous, pure implementation
that's evaded me, particularly if it's a domain I'm unfamiliar with. But, feelings of
dread aside, the website works, and, against all odds, is currently the highest ranked
GitHub Pages-hosted site about software undergrads called Liam Graham. There's always
somethin' to be thankful for.</p>
